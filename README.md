# NFT Lottery 

Provide the opportunity to establish a lottery where NFTs serve as rewards.
Any individual can initiate a lottery and determine the entry fee (or opt for no fee) as well as the prizes. All participants can register, and winners are selected from the pool of registered users. The organizer of the lottery earns profits from managing the event, while potentially sharing a small portion with the maintainer.

The Terrand on-chain beacon is utilized for generating random outcomes.

The contract is currently undergoing development, focusing on implementing safety measures to protect the players' interests and secure the funds.
